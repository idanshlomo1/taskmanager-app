# Task Manager Application

This is a Next.js based Task Manager Application designed to help you organize and track your tasks efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A MongoDB database

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager-application.git](https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager-application.git)
cd task-manager-application

```plaintext

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following:
```

NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=[https://taskmanager-app-psi.vercel.app](https://taskmanager-app-psi.vercel.app)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_c2VsZWN0LXdoYWxlLTkyLmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

```plaintext

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:
```

DATABASE_URL="your_mongodb_connection_string"
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key

```plaintext

Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your MongoDB database connection string
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: Your Clerk secret key for authentication

Note: Make sure not to commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already included in the .gitignore file for your protection.

### Installation

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Database Setup

This project uses Prisma as an ORM with MongoDB. To set up your database:

1. Run Prisma migrations:

```plaintext

```




### Running the Application

# or
